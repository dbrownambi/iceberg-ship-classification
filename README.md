Participated in the [Statoil/C-CORE Iceberg Classifier Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/statoil-iceberg-classifier-challenge)

Built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that automatically identifies if a remotely sensed target is a ship or an iceberg from
the given satellite image dataset provided by Statoil/C-Core.

[Modified different hyper-parameters to achieve an accuracy of accuracy of 0.92 and a minimum log loss error of 0.21](https://github.com/dbrownambi/iceberg-ship-classification/blob/master/EE%20258_Project%202.pdf)

Obtained a kaggle Rank of 1056 out of the 3343 entriesmore than in the competition:
