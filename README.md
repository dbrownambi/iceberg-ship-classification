Participated in the [Statoil/C-CORE Iceberg Classifier Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/statoil-iceberg-classifier-challenge)

Built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that automatically identifies if a remotely sensed target is a ship or an iceberg from
the given satellite image dataset provided by Statoil/C-Core.

Modified different hyper-parameters to achieve an accuracy of accuracy of 0.92 and a minimum log loss error of 0.21
